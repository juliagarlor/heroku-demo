# heroku-demo

This project has been developed as an example of how to deploy a Spring Boot + Angular project in Heroku. May you have any doubt or feedback, please, tell me and I will do my best.

I have left some useful instructions in the file lineasTop.txt, but you can see the complete development of this project in the following videos:

- Deploy of a monolithic Spring Boot backend with local MySQL database and PosgreSQL database for production: https://youtu.be/8DTjrOrJqvs
- Deploy of an Angular frontend connected to the previous backend: https://youtu.be/PXQLjEwHrKo
- Deploy of a microservices based Spring Boot backend: https://youtu.be/UNVpdcEKENE

I hope this might be useful. Thanks
